Welcome to the official Myriad Blitz repository.

## Description

Myriad Blitz is a singleplayer, side-view infinity run shooter game with
multiple playable characters and swarms of enemies trying to end you.
It has simple mechanics, pixel graphics and just enough complexity to
serve some fun.

## Some History

The project originally started in December 2017, when I came up with an idea
to make a very simple game as a joke for a couple of my friends on Christmas.
And so, pompously named "Christmas Donger", the first ever version of what
would later become Myriad Blitz was born. The game was received warmly despite
many flaws, and since at the time I was burned out on a different game project
I had been developing (Audiobatics), I had decided to continue working on it
in my spare time.

Fast forward a few years, and the project has evolved a lot.
There was never a big community of players behind it, mostly just me brushing
up on my programming and spriting skills and dropping updates for my small
Discord server. While it lasted a long time and I enjoyed most of it, 2019
greeted me with brand new learning opportunities (most notably I've moved to Linux),
and Myriad Blitz would be shoved to the side more and more, to the point where
as of writing this in 2020, I am considering the project concluded, despite
not being as complete as I wish it would be.

## Installation

If you wish to compile the project, you will need GameMaker: Studio, which is
paid proprietary software. Binaries are packaged and available for free to
Windows users. I've never had the GMS modules that would allow me to compile for
other platforms.
